# üçØ Honey Butter for Waffle.io

Honey Butter is a Chrome Extension that enables you to create and use Issue templates in Waffle.io! Templates are the 3rd [most requested feature](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/issues/2398) in Waffle.io.

## How It Works

Honey Butter adds a template drop down to the Add Issue form in Waffle.io projects. You can select a template when creating an issue which will replace the issue descripton with the template. Templates are defined in this extension. In the future, the extension might use [GitHub Issue Templates](https://help.github.com/articles/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository/).
